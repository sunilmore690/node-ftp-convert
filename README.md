Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ftp] - Node Ftp library
* [exceljs] - To convert inot xlsx file
* [csvtojson] - To convert csv data to json

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

To pickup file from local dir and  after convert put this file to  local  dir

```sh
let options = {
         input: {
             medium: 'local',
             file: '/usr/scott/input/filename',//absolute location of file
             type: 'csv'
         },
         output: {
             medium: 'ftp',
             path: '/abosolute/output/file/path', //Directory where to put output file
             type: 'xlsx',
             ftp: {
                 user: <username>,//
                 password: <password>,
                 host: <ftp host addreess>,
                 port: <ftp port>//21
         }
         }
     }
let ftpconvert = new FtpConvert(options
)
ftpconvert.start();
ftpconvert.on('done', function () {
    console.log('-----done----')
})
    .on('error', function (error) {
        console.error(error);
    })
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd] |

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
